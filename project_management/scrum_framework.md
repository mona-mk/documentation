# Scrum framework

Every scrum initiative starts with an idea. In most cases that idea comes from a group that we call stakeholders. That group of stakeholders or a subset of that group also provides a budget. Budget and idea are handed over to the scrum team or specifically the product owner. Every product owner has one goal and one goal only: build a product that makes as many stakeholders as happy as possible.

In order to achieve this a product owner needs support. That’s where the developers come in. Product owner decides what to build, developers decide how to build from a technical perspective. One thing is missing, someone that works on how we collaborate as a group, how we become more effective as a team, that someone is the scrum master.

This scrum thing need to do a few things before they enter their first sprint. Among those things are a shared understanding of how we work together, a shared understanding of what are we going to work on, and we also need a product backlog that helps us get into the execution mode.
* working agreement
* product goal / vision
* product backlog

We put the work agreement next to scrum master. A good scrum master knows that if a team doesn’t have a shared understanding on how they are going to work together, when events are going to happen, what they value as a team, that team is doomed to fail. So scrum master create a workshop where a group of people decide collaboratively what this agreement should be. They can use various templates for this.

The product owner’s name is next to product goal. It is the product owner’s responsibility to clear transparency along these 4 aspects:
* Who are we building the product for?
* What are their needs, pains or gains?
* What does the solution look like?
* How does this solution or this whole initiative deliver towards our organisations’s strategy, what is the business value and why we should do this as an organisation

From the product goal, you can create the product backlog. This product backlog again has 4 key characteristics:
* Every product backlog needs to be prioritised, there needs to be clear order based on customer value
* Based on the priority, we detail the different requirements. The requirements that are on top should be very small and very granular, because the team needs to select them in the next sprint. The items at the bottom can be still vague and cloudy, so that we can save time here. 
* Every product backlog is a living document. Based on feedback from stakeholders we constantly refine the product backlog (change order, break down item, exclude item)
* We want the product backlog to be estimated, at least the top items, so that the product owner can make projections with regard to the next release towards the stakeholders.

When we have the scrum team, work agreement, product goal and product backlog, we can go our sprint. Every sprint starts out with a sprint planning event. It consists of three elements:
* What is our product goal?
* Based on priority and capacity of developers, developers select items from product backlog and move them to the sprint backlog
* Developers now discuss how they want to implement those items, and some teams even breakdown each task to bring more transparency
The results of sprint planning is sprint backlog. In most cases, this is structured as a Kanban board.

After sprint planning the team moves to execution and delivery phase. In order to move synchronised throughout this delivery phase, the team does daily stand ups or daily scrum meeting, where the team answers 3 questions:
* what did we achieve yesterday with regard to our sprint goal
* what are we going to achieve today with regard to our sprint goal
* are there any impediments that keep us from achieving our sprint goal

At the end of sprint, the team delivers a product increment. That product increment needs to meet the team’s definition of done. Which is again another agreement on what done means:
* Does it mean the items are tested? what kind of test?
* Does it mean the items are documented? How?

We now take that product increment and demonstrate to our stakeholders as part of the sprint review meeting. After presentation we engage in feedback conversation with stakeholders. And last we provide them with an outlook on what they can expect to come up next. The feedback we receive is usually new product backlog items. But it is the authority of the product owner to decide where those items should be prioritised.

The final meeting is the sprint retrospective. Compared to review where our focus is on what we want to work on, the retrospective covers how we worked together, how can we improve our collaboration. The scrum master facilitates this meeting very actively. One approach is 5-step approach towards running an effective retrospective:
* Set the stage: you make sure everyone know what are we going to talk about in the next 45-60min
* Gather data: different perspective on how did we collaborate, how did tools work..
* Generate insight: in most cases you pick 1-2 items that didn’t workout very well, and you dive deeper on those items
* Decide what to do: what we actually want to do differently in our next sprint. That action item referred to as Kaizen (Japanese word for continuous improvement) moves to our next sprint backlog
* Closing the retrospective: summarise what we discuss, highlight what are we going to improve in next retrospective, and also get feedback on how retrospective was performed.

After retrospective, we would ideally start the next sprint. At this stage, our backlog, after previous sprint planning is not anymore up to date, therefore, in order to solve this, we do frequent and regular product backlog refinement. Product backlog refinement happens throughout the delivery phase of previous sprint.
