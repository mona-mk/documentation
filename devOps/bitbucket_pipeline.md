What is Bitbucket continuous integration and continuous deployment:

> Bitbucket Pipelines is an integrated CI/CD service built into Bitbucket. It allows you to automatically build, test, and even deploy your code based on a configuration file in your repository. Essentially, we create containers in the cloud for you. Inside these containers, you can run commands (like you might on a local machine) but with all the advantages of a fresh system, customized and configured for your needs.


* [Configure bitbucket-pipelines.yml](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/bitbucket-pipelines-configuration-reference/)
* [Use docker images as build environments](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/use-docker-images-as-build-environments/)
* [Run docker commands in Bitbucket pipelines](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/run-docker-commands-in-bitbucket-pipelines/)
* [Databases and service containers](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/databases-and-service-containers/)
* [Specify dependencies in your pipeline builds](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/specify-dependencies-in-your-pipelines-build/)
* [YAML anchors+aliases, overriding values](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/yaml-anchors/)
* [Use artifacts in steps](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/use-artifacts-in-steps/)
* [Caches](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/cache-dependencies/)
* [Push back to your repositories](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/push-back-to-your-repository/)

There are a lot of examples of different integrations or deployments on the Bitbucket repo itself, so explore those if you need boiler plate code:
