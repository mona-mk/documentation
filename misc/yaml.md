YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is used widely for configurations nowadays in many tools. Of course it is human readable so you wonâ€™t have much problem reading and understanding the configuration. File format is either `.yml` or `.yaml`. YAML is a superset of JSON, any valid JSON is valid YAML file. In XML, data structures are defined using `<>` and in JSON using `{}`, but in YAML data structures are defined through line separation and indentation.

**YAML syntax**

* individual key-value pairs
```
app: myappname
version: 1.7
port: 9000
```
* you don't need quotes for strings, but you can use if you want. Both single and double quotes work. If you need to use some special characters like line carriage `\n`, then you have to enclose the string is quotes.
* comment `#`
* you can have objects by wrapping say a individual key-value pairs in a key
```
microservice:
    app: myappname
    version: 1.7
    port: 9000
```
* you can have a list
```
microservice:
    - app: myappname
      version: 1.7
      port: 9000
    - app: mysecondappname
      version: 0.1
      port: 10000
```
* you can also have list of simple values
```
microservice:
    - myappname
    - mysecondappname
    - mythirdappname
```
* if you have primitive list values (not list of objects), you can simply express them with:
```
version:
    - 0.1
    - 0.2
    - 0.3
version: [0.1, 0.2, 0.3]
```
* boolean values can be any of these: yes/no, on/off, true/false
* multiline strings & long single line strings. For instance, the whole content of a shell script can be a multiline string.
```
multilineString: "this is line break \n"
multilineString: |
    this is first line
    and this is second line
    with pipe, it keeps line break as line break.
singlelineString: >
    this is a very long string
    that for readability we have 
    it on multiple line but the
    greater than sign will make it single line.
```
* you can access environment variable with `$` sign
* you can use placeholders `{{ somevalue }}`, and the value gets replaced by a template generated (the same concept is used in ansible)
* you can have multiple components inside the same yaml and you can separate them with `---`. This is for instance very useful in Kubernetes where you want to put multiple components inside a single yaml.
